1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,880
Compound interest is more common

2
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:04,010
than simple interest in banking.

3
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:06,810
This video will cover compound interest.

4
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:09,750
Many of the terms are the same between simple interest

5
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:11,790
and compound interest.

6
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:14,470
The main difference will be in the formulas.

7
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:17,300
We will cover the compound interest formula.

8
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:19,820
Then, we will do some examples.

9
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:22,600
I will include calculator steps too.

10
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,430
Let's start with the compound interest formula.

11
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:26,990
With compound interest,

12
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:30,620
the interest is added to the principal at regular intervals.

13
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:34,580
We calculate the interest with the updated principal each time.

14
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:37,050
The time between adding interest to the principal

15
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:39,470
is called a compounding period.

16
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:41,970
Here is the compound interest formula.

17
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:45,800
The variables are very similar to the simple interest formula.

18
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,260
The new variable is the compounding periods per year.

19
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:53,240
For most problems, there is monthly or quarterly compounding.

20
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:56,320
Monthly compounding means n = 12.

21
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,430
Quarterly compounding means n = 4.

22
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:01,940
There is an exponent in this problem.

23
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:05,270
You will need to use a calculator to do the exponent.

24
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:07,950
These problems will seem hard at first.

25
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:11,930
Go one step at a time and they will be easier than they look.

26
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:13,750
Let's do two examples.

27
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:15,390
For this first example:

28
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:18,300
The present value is $5,000.

29
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:23,010
The annual interest rate is 0.038 as a decimal.

30
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:24,720
Time is 5 years.

31
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,800
Monthly compounding means n =12.

32
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:31,110
Start by substituting the values into the formula.

33
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:33,840
Don't try to simplify anything right now.

34
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,100
5 times 12 is 60.

35
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:41,900
Inside the parentheses simplifies to 1.003167.

36
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:44,200
I am writing six decimal places,

37
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,880
but keeping the work in the calculator.

38
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,930
You'll see the steps in a moment.

39
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:54,920
Next, raise 1.003167 to the 60th power.

40
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:59,010
The exponent button is the symbol that looks like an up arrow.

41
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:04,560
Finally, multiply 1.20887 by 5000.

42
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,460
The future value is $6,044.43.

43
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:39,460
Here are the calculator steps on the Google Calculator app. The exponent button is to the left of 1 and 4.

44
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:42,200
This last problem is just like the first.

45
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,900
The present value is $18,500.

46
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:49,550
The annual interest rate is 6.25%

47
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:51,500
Time is 17 years.

48
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,250
Compounding is quarterly.

49
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,530
That means n = 4.

50
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:58,790
Start by substituting the numbers into the formula.

51
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:02,310
Multiply 4 times 17 to get 68.

52
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:08,010
Inside the parentheses simplifies to 1.015625.

53
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:13,240
Raise 1.015625 to the 68th power.

54
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:16,360
to get 2.86992.

55
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:22,470
Lastly, multiply 18500 and 2.86992.

56
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:27,780
The future value is $53,093.55.

57
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:53,780
Here are the calculator steps for this problem.
