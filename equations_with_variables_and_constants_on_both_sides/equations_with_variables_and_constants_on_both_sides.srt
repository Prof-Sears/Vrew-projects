00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,530
Solving equations with variable on both sides is an important skill in algebra.

2
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:10,080
Many problems later in the course have this as a part of their solution.

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:15,290
This video will cover the genera strategy for solving these types of equations.

4
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:18,190
Then, we will go through two examples.

5
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:20,200
Here is the general procedure.

6
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,560
Pick one side of the equation to be for the constants.

7
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:27,810
I like to pick the side with the largest coefficient of the variable.

8
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:33,420
Collect the variable terms on one side by adding or subtracting to both sides.

9
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:37,110
Afterward, collect the constant terms on the other side.

10
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:41,040
Finally, multiply or divide both sides by the same number

11
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,210
so that the coefficient of the variable is 1.

12
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:46,280
Don't forget to check your answer.

13
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,100
Let's do two examples.

14
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:50,880
Both are very common equations to solve.

15
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,330
Solve the equation.

16
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:56,190
12 q - 5 = 9q - 20.

17
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:58,490
I'm going to rewrite the equation.

18
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:03,660
We'll collect the variable terms on the left because 12 is larger than 9.

19
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:06,540
Subtract 9q from both sides.

20
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:10,800
The new equation is 3q - 5 = -20.

21
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:15,410
Next, add 5 to both sides to get the constants on the right.

22
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:19,580
Now, the equation is 3q = - 15.

23
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:22,710
Finally, divide both sides by 3.

24
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:25,690
The solution is q = -5.

25
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:27,340
Here is the work to check.

26
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:30,540
Be careful with the negative numbers in the arithmetic.

27
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:38,360
This second equation is just like the first.

28
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:42,820
8c + 7 = -3c - 37.

29
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:45,020
I'm going to copy the equation.

30
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:50,310
We'll collect the variable terms on the left because 8 is bigger than -3.

31
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:53,380
Start by adding 3c to both sides.

32
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:56,340
We're adding to cancel out the -3c.

33
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:02,050
The new version of the equation is 11c + 7 = -37.

34
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:04,670
Subtract 7 from both sides.

35
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:09,760
11c = -44 is the next version of the equation.

36
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:12,250
Divide both sides by 11.

37
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:15,190
The solution is c = -4.

38
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:17,560
Here is the work to check the equation.

39
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:20,860
There are lots of negative numbers, so be careful.
