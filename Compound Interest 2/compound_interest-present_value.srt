1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,290
This is our second video about compound interest.

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:06,760
We will work the problems from the last video backwards.

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:08,440
This video will cover:

4
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:11,710
The present value formula for compound interest.

5
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:14,020
Then we'll do three problems.

6
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:16,650
I'll show the solutions on a calculator.

7
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:18,820
First, a few reminders.

8
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:23,140
The present value of an account or investment is the value now.

9
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:25,540
The future value of an account or investment

10
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:28,700
is the value in a given time in the future.

11
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:31,710
The reason we want to calculate present value is to know

12
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:35,240
how much money we need now to reach a future goal.

13
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:38,250
We can use the rest of our money for other things.

14
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:41,860
For example, if you need $20,000 to buy a car

15
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:46,060
five years from now, how much do we need to invest today?

16
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:48,710
First, we'll look at the present value formula

17
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:51,000
using compound interest.

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,330
Here is the formula.

19
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:55,190
The bottom of the fraction is exactly the calculation

20
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:57,460
we did with future value.

21
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:59,870
The difference is that we're dividing by the number

22
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:01,970
instead of multiplying.

23
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:05,110
The best way to do the division in a calculator

24
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:08,230
is to use the calculator's memory function.

25
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:10,380
Let's go through some examples.

26
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:11,900
In the first example:

27
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:15,310
Future value is $250,000.

28
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:20,360
Annual interest rate is 0.0345 as a decimal.

29
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,530
Time is 25 years.

30
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:25,570
Annual compounding means n equals 1.

31
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:28,960
First, substitute the values into the equation.

32
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,320
Don't try to simplify at this step.

33
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:36,110
Multiply 1 times 25 to get an exponent of 25.

34
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:41,280
The part in the parentheses simplifies to 1.0345.

35
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,000
After taking the exponent,

36
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,630
the bottom of the fraction is 2.334868.

37
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:49,980
Finally, after doing the division,

38
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:55,840
we get $107,072.43 for the present value.

39
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,230
This means we more than double our money over 25 years.

40
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:16,230
Here is the calculation on the Google Calculator app.

41
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:26,230
For this step, use the history to copy and paste the old number.

42
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:27,510
For this problem:

43
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:30,910
Future value is $150,000.

44
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:35,820
Annual interest rate is 0.0481 as a decimal.

45
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,990
Time is 35 years.

46
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:41,100
Quarterly compounding means n equals 4.

47
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:44,490
First, substitute the values into the equation.

48
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:49,500
Multiply 4 times 35 to get an exponent of 140.

49
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:55,350
The part in the parentheses simplifies to 1.012025.

50
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:56,760
Doing the exponent,

51
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:02,170
the bottom of the fraction becomes 5.330571.

52
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:09,210
Perform the division to get $28,139.58 for the present value.

53
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:12,930
The future value is more than five times the starting money.

54
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:37,930
The calculator steps are the same as the last problem.

55
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:39,880
This is the last problem:

56
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:43,280
Future value is $150,000.

57
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:48,190
Annual interest rate is 0.0481 as a decimal.

58
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:50,360
Time is 35 years.

59
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:53,440
Monthly compounding means n equals 12.

60
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,410
This is almost the same as the last problem.

61
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:59,270
The number of compounding periods is different.

62
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:02,660
First, substitute the values into the equation.

63
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:07,770
Multiply 12 times 35 to get an exponent of 420.

64
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:13,190
The parentheses simplifies to 1.004008.

65
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:14,600
Doing the exponent,

66
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:19,800
the bottom of the fraction becomes 5.366280.

67
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:27,040
Perform the division to get $27,952.33 for the present value.

68
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:52,040
More after this.

69
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,620
The present value is lower

70
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:56,510
in this problem than in the last problem.

71
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:59,150
That is because with more compounding periods,

72
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:01,670
the money grows a little faster.

73
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:05,650
So, you can start with less and end with the same amount.
