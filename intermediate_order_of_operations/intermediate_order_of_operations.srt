1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,590
There are several layers to the order of operations.

2
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:05,650
Now that we’ve looked at some order of operations problems,

3
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:07,870
let’s try some that are a bit more involved.

4
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:11,090
This video will do a quick review of the order of operations.

5
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:13,090
Then, we’ll work two examples.

6
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:15,950
We covered the order of operations in greater detail.

7
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:17,810
For this video, we’ll do a short review.

8
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:21,600
When you simplify an expression, work in the following steps.

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,710
Parentheses first, working inside to outside.

10
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:27,050
Second, do all exponents.

11
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:30,480
The third level is to do all multiplications and divisions.

12
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,190
Do them at the same time, working left to right.

13
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:36,280
Finally, perform all additions and subtractions.

14
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:39,720
Again, do them at the same time, working left to right.

15
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,570
Let’s work through two examples.

16
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:48,760
The first example is 3 times parentheses 1 plus 9 times 6 then minus 4 squared.

17
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,970
First we work inside the parentheses.

18
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:56,280
The first operation to do inside the parentheses is 9 times 6, which is 54.

19
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,450
The second operation inside the parentheses is 1 plus 54.

20
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:02,840
The parentheses simplifies to 55.

21
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,530
We’re done with the parentheses.

22
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:06,430
Next up is exponents.

23
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:07,990
4 squared is 16

24
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:09,660
We’re done with exponents.

25
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:11,920
The next operation is multiplication.

26
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,300
3 times 55 is 165.

27
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,160
Finally, we subtract.

28
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:21,260
165 minus 16 is 149.

29
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:24,120
The final answer is 149.

30
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:27,350
The next example has brackets and parentheses.

31
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:29,560
Work inside to outside.

32
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:35,940
We want to simplify 2 bracket 1 plus 3 times parentheses 10 minus 2.

33
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:37,950
Subtract inside the parentheses.

34
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:39,580
10 minus 2 is 8

35
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:43,100
Inside the brackets, do the multiplication first.

36
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:45,240
3 times 8 is 24.

37
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,610
To finish inside the brackets, add 1 and 24.

38
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:51,150
The brackets simplify to be 25.

39
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:53,140
We’ve done all the grouping symbols.

40
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:56,090
Also, there are no exponents in the problem.

41
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:58,670
There is one multiplication left.

42
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:00,750
2 times 25 is 50.

43
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:03,450
There are no additions or subtractions left either.

44
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:05,050
The final answer is 50.
